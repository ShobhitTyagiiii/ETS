## 🔧 Offline Features

### ✅ What Works Offline
- Complete expense tracking functionality
- User authentication and authorization
- Dashboard with charts and analytics
- Expense submission and management
- Report generation (PDF/Excel)
- File upload for invoices
- All CRUD operations

### 📊 Features

- **My Submissions:** View and manage your expenses
- **Reports:** Generate detailed expense reports
- **Admin Panel:** Full administrative control
- **Role-based Access:** Different permissions for different user types

### 🗄️ Database
- Uses SQLite database (`db.sqlite3`)
- No external database connection required
- All data stored locally

### 📁 File Storage
- Invoice uploads stored in `media/invoices/`
- Static files served locally
- No external CDN dependencies

## 🛠️ Offline Optimizations

### Settings Changes
- `ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['*']` - Accepts connections from any host
- `TIME_ZONE = 'UTC'` - Universal timezone for consistency
- `SESSION_COOKIE_AGE = 86400` - 24-hour sessions for convenience
- `SESSION_EXPIRE_AT_BROWSER_CLOSE = False` - Sessions persist across browser restarts

### Security Considerations
- HTTPS disabled for local development
- CSRF protection still active
- Session security maintained
- File upload validation active
